D is worng: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/statements_9012.htm

When you drop a table, any indexes on the table are dropped and put into the recycle bin along with the table. If subsequent space pressures arise, then the database reclaims space from the recycle bin by first purging indexes. In this case, when you flash back the table, you may not get back all of the indexes that were defined on the table.
