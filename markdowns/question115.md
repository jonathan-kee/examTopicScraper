# Question 115
Which statement is true about TRUNCATE and DELETE?

# Answers
A.For tables with multiple indexes and triggers, DELETE is faster than TRUNCATE.

B.You can never TRUNCATE a table if foreign key constraints would be violated.

C.You can DELETE rows from a table with referential integrity constraints.

D.For large tables, DELETE is faster than TRUNCATE.

# Discussions
## Discussion 1
C.
A and D: False --> Truncate is better and has better performance than delete and Drop except for very small tables.
B False --> You can truncate a table with a FK on Cascade.  You can disable FK and then Truncate (except if FK is self-refential).

## Discussion 2
i think C is correct if the referential integrity constraint has the ON DELETE CASCADE option

## Discussion 3
C is correct since you can delete using cascade option 
B is incorrect since it says never but you can by disable the constraint

## Discussion 4
B is correct

## Discussion 5
C is correct,
We can trucate table contains referential integrity, one by drop the constraint/ while adding constraint we can include on delete cascade . Truncate table colors cascade; this statement will run successfully.
