c is incorrect ->The set operators are not valid on columns of type BLOB, CLOB, BFILE, VARRAY, or nested table.

i think D E are correct
The UNION, INTERSECT, and MINUS operators are not valid on LONG columns.

AE for me - I don't think they need to match exactly.

## Discussion 5
Not A. because "Data type group" isn’t a strict SQL requirement — Oracle uses implicit conversion, not strict groups.
