why is not B?
C used SQLPLUS is right but use sql developer ....Maybe not

## Discussion 2
BCD is correct.

## Discussion 3
A is not successful DML

I CHECKED making an experiment and A IS CORRECT answer.
Looks like just CREATE TABLE AS creates a COMMIT (error  was placed later - I used unexisting table as a source)

## Discussion 5
For A to be true the statement would have to be syntactically valid.
