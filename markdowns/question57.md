AEF
B is wrong an additional column will appear at the end
C is wrong default value will affect rows that will be inserted after creating default constraint

## Discussion 2
AEF for me

## Discussion 3
AEF is 100% correct.

## Discussion 4
why not ADE?
will E work? when we add a new column with default value, will it use that default value automatically for all the existing rows? im not sure, I know that it will do so for new ones though.
as for D, shouldnt it be possible? as dates are stored as numeric value in the DB from what I know..
