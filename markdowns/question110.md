To create a relational table in your own schema, you must have the CREATE TABLE system privilege. To create a table in another user's schema, you must have the CREATE ANY TABLE system privilege.
A) is wrong because external table creates a file only if it's created with 'CREATE AS SELECT' statement

BC cuz google says:
'System privileges allow a user to perform a particular database operation or class of database operations. For example, to create a table, the user needs the create table privilege.'
'Objects have privileges associated with them, such as insert, update and delete a table.'
