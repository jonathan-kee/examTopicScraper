Note on C: you can add the same name and data type as unused column even if it's not dropped. Tested and it works.

## Discussion 2
B C.
Note on C. You can only add a new column with the same name as long as it's a different data type until the UNUSED is dropped.

## Discussion 3
Option B: "Unused columns retain their data until they are dropped."
This is correct. Unused columns keep their data until they are explicitly removed from the table. Setting a column to unused does not immediately delete its data; it only marks the column as unavailable.

Option C: "Once a column has been set to unused, a new column with the same name can be added to the table."
This is correct. Once a column is marked as unused, you can add a new column with the same name to the table, because the unused column is effectively 'removed' from the tableâ€™s structure in a logical sense.

## Discussion 4
I tested, Unused can be added on primary key.
Desc does not display unused column. not does select query.
