## Discussion 2
You cannot truncate the parent table of an enabled foreign key constraint. You must disable the constraint before truncating the table. An exception is that you can truncate the table if the integrity constraint is self-referential.

## Discussion 3
Answer is C. The key word is 'if' foreign contstraints will be be violated. Meaning, the TRUNCATE 'will' violate the foreign constraints.

## Discussion 4
B correct answer should be B

## Discussion 5
