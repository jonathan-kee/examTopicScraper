## Discussion 2
BEF is correct

## Discussion 3
A GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE in Oracle cannot have a PUBLIC SYNONYM. Synonyms, especially public ones, are meant to provide a consistent and global alias to database objects. However, Global Temporary Tables (GTTs) have session-specific or transaction-specific data, and allowing a public synonym for such a table could lead to confusion or conflicts due to its session-dependent behavior.
