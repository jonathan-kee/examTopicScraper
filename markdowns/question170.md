E.The same table column cannot be part of a unique and non-unique index.

c. No, that statement is not necessarily true. If a query filters on an indexed column, the optimizer will decide whether or not to use the index based on factors such as the selectivity of the filter and the size of the table. In some cases, a full table scan may be more efficient than using an index.
