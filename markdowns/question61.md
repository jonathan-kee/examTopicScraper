✅ B. Outer joins can be used when there are multiple join conditions on two tables.
➡️ True – You can absolutely have multiple conditions in an outer join using AND, and it works across columns.

A. Option A is true. A full outer join returns both matched rows and unmatched rows from the joined tables. Matched rows are those that satisfy the join condition, while unmatched rows are those that do not have a matching row in the other table.

B. Option B is true. Outer joins can be used when there are multiple join conditions on two tables. This allows for more complex join conditions and provides flexibility in joining tables based on multiple criteria.

F. Option F is true. An inner join returns only the matched rows from the joined tables. It filters out the unmatched rows, resulting in a result set that contains only the rows that satisfy the join condition.
