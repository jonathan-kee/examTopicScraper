# Discussions
## Discussion 1
I would say B and C - as the core features of SQL.
Providing variable definition, as I would see it, a flavour added to the Oracle SQL dialect.

## Discussion 2
The two SQL features are:

B. Processing sets of data.

SQL is primarily designed for processing sets of data. It allows you to query, insert, update, and delete data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL statements operate on sets of records, and you can use SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data in databases.

E. Providing variable definition capabilities.

SQL supports variable definition capabilities through the use of variables and parameters. You can declare and use variables and parameters within SQL statements to store and manipulate data.

## Discussion 3
My hesitation on this one is E.
