How F is correct. 
In case argument is passed in a negative. eg -1.4. The output is -2.
But -1 is greater than -2. And, its contrast with option F.
F. FLOOR returns the largest integer less than or equal to a specified number.

select floor(-1.4) from dual;
o/p
---2

B is correct, CONCAT joins two or more arguments.

--Example query
select concat('this ', 'is ', 'a ', 'test') concat from dual;

Output: "this is a test"

F is also correct, since it accepts negative numbers as well.

--Example query
select floor(-5.2526) from dual;

Output: -6 (-6 is smaller than -5, it also caught me offguard the first time).
