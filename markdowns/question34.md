## Discussion 1
Tried all the alternatives

## Discussion 2
I am assuming it is supposed to be to_date

## Discussion 3
A is also right why?...
✅ A. SELECT 1 - SYSDATE - DATE '2019-01-01' FROM DUAL;
Valid: Oracle allows arithmetic with dates and numbers.

1 - SYSDATE gives a negative number (interval), and subtracting another DATE results in a valid numeric result.

✅ Executes successfully
