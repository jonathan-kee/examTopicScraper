## Discussion 1
i am finding 3 that are correct. CEF

## Discussion 2
I think itâ€™s CE ?

## Discussion 3
F is wrong
because the column last_name has a not null constraint, in this case Oracle will not accept '' as value for the last_name column

CE is the correct answer

## Discussion 4
CF is correct. 
in F, if have space between ' ' for last Name, it will be accepted. if there is no space, then not null constraint will apply.

## Discussion 5
CEF are corret. I checked in data base.
