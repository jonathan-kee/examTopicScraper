select tzname, tz_offset(tzname) from v$timezone_names;

select tzname, tz_offset(tzname) from v$timezone_names
where tzname = 'America/Anchorage';

alter session set time_zone='America/Anchorage';

select sessiontimezone, current_timestamp, dbtimezone, systimestamp  from dual;

select current_time from dual;

A → OK.
B → NOOK: Returns TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE.
C → NOOK: No, in the SESSIONTIMEZONE..
D → CURRENT_TIME doesn’t exist.
E → NOOK: No, in the SESSIONTIMEZONE.
F → NOOK.  SYSTIMESTMP returns date based on DBSTIMEZONE.

## Discussion 2
AB should be the correct answer

## Discussion 3
A seems 100%.  B is correct if you consider timestamp as the overarching data type of timestamp with time zone and timestamp with local time zone.  However if D says current_date then I like AD over AB.

## Discussion 4
A & B are correct! 
C & E are incorrect because CURRENT_TIMESTAMP reflects the session time zone, not
DBTIMEZONE

## Discussion 5
A - Is correct
D - Should be either CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or CURRENT_DATE
