## Discussion 3
AE is the right answer.

## Discussion 4
Correct answer is: AB
A. Virtual columns can be indexed just like regular columns. This is useful when queries frequently filter or sort data based on the virtual column, as indexing improves performance.

B. Virtual columns can be used in the expression of another virtual column. This allows for more complex derived data to be generated from other columns, including other virtual columns.

## Discussion 5
E is false. Although virtual columns can be used in a WHERE clause of queries to filter data, they cannot be used in the WHERE clause of an UPDATE or DELETE statement because these statements modify data, and virtual columns are not physically stored.
