# Discussions
## Discussion 1
A,E is correct answers.

## Discussion 2
- A: Grants the CREATE SEQUENCE system privilege to both the manager and emp roles.
It is valid to specify multiple roles or users in a single GRANT statement.
- B: CREATE TABLE is a system privilege, and privileges can be granted to roles.
- C: CREATE ANY SESSION is not a valid privilege in Oracle. It should be CREATE SESSION instead
- D: This syntax is valid.
- E: CREATE TABLE is a system privilege, and SELECT is an object privilege.
System and object privileges cannot be granted in the same GRANT statement

## Discussion 3
can grant system and object privileges in same grant statement

## Discussion 4
This command grants the CREATE TABLE privilege and SELECT privilege on the HR.EMPLOYEES table to the MANAGER role. This is valid syntax, as it grants both a system privilege and an object privilege to a role.
 That's by A,E is correct
