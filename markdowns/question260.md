# Discussions
## Discussion 1
A. SALES1 is created with 55,000 rows.
  The `WHERE 1=1` condition is always true, so it selects **all rows** from `sales`.  
  Since `sales` has **55,000 rows**, `sales1` will also have **55,000 rows**.

B. SALES1 has NOT NULL constraints on any selected columns which had those constraints in the SALES table.
  Oracle preserves `NOT NULL` constraints** during CTAS. These are the **only constraints** that are automatically copied over.  
  Other constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `FOREIGN KEY` are **not** retained.

## Discussion 2
Just a shot in the dark, but maybe D?
