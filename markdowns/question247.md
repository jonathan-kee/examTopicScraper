DEF for me,    
CHAR default is 1 byte, 
we can use: CREATE TABLE tmp (col CHAR);

## Discussion 2
Answer is A,E,F

## Discussion 3
Yes, you can create a table in ORACLE without specifying the length in CHAR column.
D is right.

## Discussion 4
A is incorrect because of the word "always".

## Discussion 5
If you do not specify a qualifier, the value of the NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS parameter of the session creating the column defines the length semantics, unless the table belongs to the schema SYS, in which case the default semantics is BYTE.
