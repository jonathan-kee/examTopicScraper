✅ C. It can be used only in SQL*Plus.
True. SET VERIFY ON is a command specific to SQL*Plus (and tools that emulate it).
It is not supported in GUI tools like SQL Developer (though similar behavior can sometimes be simulated).

✅ D. It displays values for variables prefixed with &&.
True. When SET VERIFY ON is enabled, SQL*Plus displays the old and new values of substitution variables (like &&var) before executing the SQL.

❌ Incorrect options:
A. It displays values for variables used only in the WHERE clause of a query.
➤ False. It shows substituted values regardless of where they are used, not just in the WHERE clause.

B. It displays values for variables created by the DEFINE command.
➤ False. SET VERIFY ON shows values of substitution variables, not necessarily those created by DEFINE.

E. It can be used in SQL Developer and SQLPlus.*
➤ False. SET VERIFY ON works only in SQL*Plus. SQL Developer ignores it.
