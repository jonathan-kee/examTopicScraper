# Discussions
## Discussion 1
CE are correct
B I think is correct as well?

## Discussion 2
A - is correct, because INSERT FIRST evaluates conditions in order and inserts a row into the first matching target only. So a source row never gets inserted into more than one table with INSERT FIRST.
C - is correct because it describes what INSERT ALL does. One row from the source can be 
inserted into multiple target tables.
E - "is not Correct" --> The word “always” makes this statement false. Also, Multitable INSERT statements use a SELECT to generate source rows. And the SELECT can be a subquery, but it can also be a direct table or view.

## Discussion 3
CD is correct
