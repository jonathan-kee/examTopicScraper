## Discussion 1
Correct answer is D
SELECT e.last_name, hire_date, sysdate,        
(CASE WHEN  (sysdate -TO_YMINTERVAL('15-0')) >= hire_date THEN '15 years of service'
WHEN (sysdate -TO_YMINTERVAL('10-0'))                  >= hire_date THEN '10 years of service'
WHEN (sysdate - TO_YMINTERVAL('5-0'))                   >= hire_date  THEN '5 years of service'
ELSE '<5 years of service' END) AS years      
FROM   employees 
ORDER BY hire_date

## Discussion 2
Logic has to be higher to lower otherwise condition will not address 2nd row D is correct 

select last_name, hire_date,

Case
    When sysdate - to_yminterval ('20-0') >= hire_date then 'Older than 20 years Employees'
    When sysdate - to_yminterval ('10-0') >= hire_date then 'Older than 10 years Employees'
    When sysdate - to_yminterval ('5-0') >= hire_date then 'Older than 5 years Employees'
    Else 'New Employees'
END as "Employees Duration"
from emp
order by "Employees Duration" desc
;
