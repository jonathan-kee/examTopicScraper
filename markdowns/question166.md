fail A -  because in the subquery exist condition referenced to main table but not subquery table. By other words, in the subquery not exist limitation for fetching rows and subquery return more than one row

## Discussion 2
is the A 
the correct A is 
select count(*)
from hr.employees e
where e.salary < (select a.salary from hr. employees a where a.employee_id=110);
