## Discussion 1
TRUNC does nothing here. The rounding of -2 gives closest order of 100, 156->200. Then 200 is truncated to 200

## Discussion 2
B is correct, run it in SQL Developer

## Discussion 3
A is the right one : 
The ROUND(156.00, -2) function call rounds the number 156.00 to the nearest hundredth, resulting in the value 200.

The TRUNC(200, -1) function call truncates the number 200 to the nearest ten, resulting in the value 150.

Therefore, the final result of the SQL query is 150.

## Discussion 4
Answer is B

## Discussion 5
can someone explain why the answer is 200?
