D 'WARNING:The privileges needed to access files in a directory object are operating system specific. UTL_FILE directory object privileges give you read and write access to all files within the specified directory.'

## Discussion 2
A. Query any table in a database.
True. The ability to query any table across the database requires the SELECT ANY TABLE system privilege. This is a system-level permission and not specific to objects within a user's schema.
B. Execute a procedure in another schema.
True. To execute a procedure in another schema, a user would need the EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE system privilege. While direct object privileges can be granted to execute a specific procedure, the system privilege is broader and not restricted to a single schema.
C. Log in to a database instance.
True. Logging in to a database instance requires the CREATE SESSION system privilege. This is a fundamental system privilege that grants the user the ability to connect to the database.
