Inner join can be done on different tables . Same table is called self join

## Discussion 2
I thought that the option "A" for this question would apply the same reasoning as the question 50, where the option that said "PRODUCT_PRICE can be used in an arithmetic expression even if it has no value stored in it." was justified by saying "it doesn't make sense, it's not advisable, but it can be done".
