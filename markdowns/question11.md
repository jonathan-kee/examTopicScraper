A. They can be nested. Scalar subqueries can be nested within other scalar subqueries or within other SQL expressions.

E. A scalar subquery expression that returns zero rows evaluates to NULL. If a scalar subquery returns no rows, it evaluates to NULL.

F. They cannot be used in GROUP BY clauses. Scalar subqueries cannot be used in GROUP BY clauses because they do not return a single value that can be used to group rows.

## Discussion 3
Why is D incorrect?

## Discussion 4
I don't think they can be nested.  Tried:
select employee_id, 
    (select department_name, (select city from locations l where l.location_id=d.location_id) 
        from departments d where d.department_id=e.department_id)
    from employees e;
But got 'too many values error'.

## Discussion 5
I also think AEF are the correct answers
