A. The names of employees earning the maximum salary will appear first in an unspecified order: Because if there more than one employ with the same salary the order is unspecified cuz both will use 'A' letter.
B. All remaining employee names will appear in descending order. Because there is last_name DESC

I should just google the answers instead of depending on the ones here...
