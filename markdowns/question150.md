# Answers
A.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (SYSDATE - hire_date) / 12 > 5;

B.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (SYSTIMSSTAMF - hire_date) / 12 > INTERVAL '5' YEAR;

C.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (CURRENT_DATE - hire_date) / 12 > 5

D.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (CURRENT_DATE - hire_date) / 365 >

E.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (SYSDATE - hire_date) / 365 > 5;

F.SELECT employee_name FROM employees WHERE (SYSTIMESTAMP - hire_date) / 365 > INTERVAL '1825' DAY;

## Discussion 1
DE is correct (even though D seems to be with typo). 
F is not correct as default precision of DAY is 2 - should be INTERVAL '1845' DAY(4)

## Discussion 2
DE is correct

## Discussion 3
I think EF.
D is with typo?

## Discussion 4
DE should be the correct answer

## Discussion 5
both SYSDATE AND HIRE_DATE AR OF TYPE date, SO SUBTRACTING IS VALID. rest are invalid.
