# Discussions
## Discussion 1
lname is in the question
SELECT city, last_name AS lname FROM members

## Discussion 2
Option BE is right!

## Discussion 3
B-E IS CORRECT.

## Discussion 4
EF cannot be right. As the question asks us to first sort by cities in the ascending order. Only then further the sorting requires for lastname is descending order. F does vice versa

## Discussion 5
BE is correct
