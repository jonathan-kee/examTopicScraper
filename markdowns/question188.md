I thought aggregate functions cannot be used in the WHERE clause?

## Discussion 2
A

select EmployeeId, sum(amount)
from Sales
group by Employee
where EmployeeId in (
    select max(EmployeeId) from Employees)

## Discussion 3
--B WRONG
--select avg(salary) from emp group by dept_id having avg(salary) > 1000;
--C WRONG
--select last_name from emp where upper(last_name) like 'A%';
--D WRONG
--Having is Used for Agg Functions. Single-row functions do not require grouping.

B is correct
But I think C as well is correct

    (select avg(salary) from employees);
