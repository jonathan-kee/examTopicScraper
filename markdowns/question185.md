B,E
create table products (prod_id char(2), prod_name char(4), exp_date timestamp(6));

create table new_products (prod_id char(4), prod_name varchar2(10), exp_date DATE);

/*A NOOK 01789. 00000 -  "query block has incorrect number of result columns"*/
SELECT prod_id FROM products 
UNION ALL 
SELECT prod_id, prod_name FROM new_products;
