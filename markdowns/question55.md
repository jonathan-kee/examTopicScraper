## Discussion 1
for Book.seq currval-  is there a logical error despite the statement does execute?

## Discussion 2
How not null and primary key can be set on the same column as primary key = not null + unique key ? I checked it is possible but technically it should not work in that way

## Discussion 3
Can any one explain A,D are the correct answers

## Discussion 4
CURRVAL might have a null value so option C may not work.
