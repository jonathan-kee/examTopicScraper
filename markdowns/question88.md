D.If the ON COMMIT clause is transaction-specific, all rows in the table are deleted after each COMMIT OR ROLLBACK.

## Discussion 1
I Think A, D. 
D -> If the ON COMMIT is transaction specific -> COMMIT, ROLLBACK delete rows.
NOT C-> Allocation of temporal segments are done on USER TEMP TABLESPACE, at time of use table, no always in the TEMP TABLESPACE of the OWNER.

## Discussion 2
AD is correct

## Discussion 3
AD is correct

## Discussion 4
A D  are correct: 
D. If the ON COMMIT clause is transaction-specific, all rows in the table are deleted after each COMMIT OR ROLLBACK.
''all rows in the table are deleted'' = TRUNCATE

## Discussion 5
C isn't correct:
By default, Oracle stores the data of the global temporary table in the default temporary tablespace of the tableâ€™s owner.

But you can explicitly assign another tablespace to a global temporary table during table creation using the TABLESPACE clause
