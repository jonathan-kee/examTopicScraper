# Discussions
## Discussion 1
Specify WITH GRANT OPTION to enable the grantee to grant the object privileges to other users and roles. The user whose schema contains an object is automatically granted all associated object privileges with the GRANT OPTION. This special privilege allows the grantee several expanded privileges:

    The grantee can grant the object privilege to any users in the database, with or without the GRANT OPTION, or to any role in the database.
    If both of the following are true, the grantee can create views on the table and grant the corresponding privileges on the views to any user or role in the database.
        The grantee receives object privileges for the table with the GRANT OPTION.
        The grantee has the CREATE VIEW or CREATE ANY VIEW system privilege.

The GRANT OPTION is not valid when granting an object privilege to a role. Oracle prevents the propagation of object privileges through roles so that grantees of a role cannot propagate object privileges received by means of roles.
