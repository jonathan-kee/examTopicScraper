## Discussion 1
I think answer B is the only correct answer because In SQL, a group function operates on a set of rows and returns a single value for each group. Group functions include AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM. These functions cannot be nested within one another. For example, in query A, the AVG function is nested within the MAX function which is not allowed. Similarly, in query C, D and E, the MAX function is nested within the AVG function which is also not allowed. 
What do you think?
