Correct Answer: ADE

## Discussion 2
Believe ADE

## Discussion 3
ADE are correct

## Discussion 4
ADE are correct:
A - TRUE; cash values are lost if instance shuts down
B - FALSE; Transaction can be rolled back if not COMMITed yet, but sequence number was already used and cannot be reused
C - FALSE; user can create sequence and therefore has all privileges to this object, including DROP
D - TRUE; CYCLE parameter can be set and values can be looped
E - TRUE; there is a list of activities that can influence the gaps generation, like failed INSERT or DELETE; COMMIT or INSERT; ROLLBACK etc.
F - FALSE; from ORACLE documentation "Sequence numbers are generated independently of tables, so the same sequence can be used for one or for multiple tables"

## Discussion 5
The whole idea of SEQUANCE is to provide unique keys so D cannot be correct. 
About F - why not?! This is something called in the code. But even as default value, there is no check for unique value accross all tables into the database.
