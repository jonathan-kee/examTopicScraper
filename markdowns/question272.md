Answer is CD

E is wrong.
  Oracle does **not have an `INDEX` object privilege**. You can’t grant someone the ability to index a table via an `INDEX` privilege—it doesn’t exist. Only `CREATE ANY INDEX` or CREATE INDEX applies.

## Discussion 2
o create an index on a table in another schema in your own schema, you must either own the table or have been granted the INDEX object privilege on that table, or possess the CREATE ANY INDEX system privilege​

. In our scenario the table isn’t owned by the user, so the user needs either the object privilege (GRANT INDEX ON table_name TO user) or the CREATE ANY INDEX privilege. Having either of those will satisfy the privilege requirement to create the index. (If the user already has CREATE ANY INDEX, that covers it; if not, the table’s owner can grant the INDEX privilege on that specific table.)
