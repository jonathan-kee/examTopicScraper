*** Topics I need to cover ***
1) DISABLE, ENABLE
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-schema-objects.html#GUID-BF457CD9-DD31-4673-BDDB-F7965A8C04E0

You can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered (INSERT, MERGE) or updated (UPDATE, MERGE) in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.
Additionally, you can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if you specify NOVALIDATE, you are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:

ENABLE, VALIDATE

ENABLE, NOVALIDATE

DISABLE, VALIDATE

DISABLE, NOVALIDATE

Examples of ENABLE, DISABLE, VALIDATE, NOVALIDATE
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-schema-objects.html#GUID-F504F7C9-D201-4B32-A25C-17650FE49002

18.5.2.1 Disabling Constraints Upon Definition
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

18.5.2.2 Enabling Constraints Upon Definition
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

18.5.3 Modifying, Renaming, or Dropping Existing Integrity Constraints
You can use the ALTER TABLE statement to enable, disable, modify, or drop a constraint. When the database is using a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY index to enforce a constraint, and constraints associated with that index are dropped or disabled, the index is dropped, unless you specify otherwise.

While enabled foreign keys reference a PRIMARY or UNIQUE key, you cannot disable or drop the PRIMARY or UNIQUE key constraint or the index.
^
Important points:
*** When the database is using a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY index to enforce a constraint, 
and constraints associated with that index are dropped or disabled, 
the index is dropped, unless you specify otherwise. ***

*** While enabled foreign keys reference a PRIMARY or UNIQUE key, 
you cannot disable or drop the PRIMARY or UNIQUE key constraint or the index. ***

18.5.3.1 Disabling and Enabling Constraints
The following statements disable integrity constraints. The second statement specifies that the associated indexes are to be kept.

ALTER TABLE dept
    DISABLE CONSTRAINT dname_ukey;

ALTER TABLE dept
    DISABLE PRIMARY KEY KEEP INDEX,
    DISABLE UNIQUE (dname, loc) KEEP INDEX;

The following statements enable novalidate disabled integrity constraints:
ALTER TABLE dept
    ENABLE NOVALIDATE CONSTRAINT dname_ukey;

ALTER TABLE dept
    ENABLE NOVALIDATE PRIMARY KEY,
    ENABLE NOVALIDATE UNIQUE (dname, loc);

The following statements enable or validate disabled integrity constraints:
ALTER TABLE dept
    MODIFY CONSTRAINT dname_key VALIDATE;

ALTER TABLE dept
    MODIFY PRIMARY KEY ENABLE NOVALIDATE;

The following statements enable disabled integrity constraints:
ALTER TABLE dept
    ENABLE CONSTRAINT dname_ukey;

ALTER TABLE dept
    ENABLE PRIMARY KEY,
    ENABLE UNIQUE (dname, loc);

To disable or drop a UNIQUE key or PRIMARY KEY constraint and all dependent FOREIGN KEY constraints in a single step, use the CASCADE option of the DISABLE or DROP clauses. For example, the following statement disables a PRIMARY KEY constraint and any FOREIGN KEY constraints that depend on it:

ALTER TABLE dept
    DISABLE PRIMARY KEY CASCADE;

^
Search 24.1.3 Replacing Views
Before replacing a view, consider the following effects:

- Replacing a view replaces the view definition in the data dictionary. All underlying objects referenced by the view are not affected.

- If a constraint in the CHECK OPTION was previously defined but not included in the new view definition, the constraint is dropped.

- All views dependent on a replaced view become invalid (not usable). 
In addition, dependent PL/SQL program units may become invalid, depending on what was changed in the new version of the view. 
For example, if only the WHERE clause of the view changes, dependent PL/SQL program units remain valid. 
However, if any changes are made to the number of view columns or to the view column names or data types, 
dependent PL/SQL program units are invalidated. 
See "Managing Object Dependencies" for more information on how the database manages such dependencies.

^
A rollback to a savepoint in an uncommitted transaction means undoing any changes made after the specified savepoint, 
but it does not mean a rollback of the transaction itself.

When a transaction is rolled back to a savepoint, as when the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT after_banda_sal is run in Table 11-1, the following occurs:

1. Oracle Database rolls back only the statements run after the savepoint.

In Table 11-1, the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT causes the UPDATE for Greene to be rolled back, but not the UPDATE for Banda.

2. Oracle Database preserves the savepoint specified in the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement, but all subsequent savepoints are lost.

In Table 11-1, the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT causes the after_greene_sal savepoint to be lost.

3. Oracle Database releases all table and row locks acquired after the specified savepoint but retains all data locks acquired before the savepoint.

The transaction remains active and can be continued.

^
I also not sure if you can rollback to a savepoint after you do rollback.
^
3.4 Rolling Back Transactions

No you cannot do that because all subsequent savepoints are lost after you rollback.

43) NLS_DATE_FORMAT, TIME_ZONE, LOCALTIMESTAMP
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/refrn/NLS_DATE_FORMAT.html

NLS_DATE_FORMAT specifies the default datetime format model to use with the TO_CHAR and TO_DATE functions. 
The default value of this parameter is determined by NLS_TERRITORY.

45) 2 Aggregate in a single line

Nesting aggregate
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Aggregate-Functions.html

You can nest aggregate functions. For example, the following example calculates the average of the maximum salaries of all the departments in the sample schema hr:

SELECT AVG(MAX(salary))
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id;

AVG(MAX(SALARY))
----------------
      10926.3333

This calculation evaluates the inner aggregate (MAX(salary)) for each group defined by the GROUP BY clause (department_id), and aggregates the results again.
