## Discussion 1
i am finding 3 that are correct. CEF

## Discussion 2
I think it’s CE ?

## Discussion 3
CEF are corret. I checked in data base.

## Discussion 4
CF is correct. 
in F, if have space between ' ' for last Name, it will be accepted. if there is no space, then not null constraint will apply.

## Discussion 5
C E are correct. F would be ok whith an space between ' '. 
If you copy and paste the exact alternative from here, it works, but I imagine that the exam doesn't have that space and that's why the're only two correct options.
